# Metronome
Web implementation of metronome, because my favorite metronome changed pricing, and it is expensive as hell.

This is example of implemetation in pure vanilla JavaScript, with no frameworks, only browsers APIs.
There are use also WebComponents (the forbidden concept of component system).

Tik tak tik tak.
